# Tyler Pyrzenski's Portfolio 💻

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Below you will find projects in **Java**, **SQL**, **C++** and **more** demonstrating my expertise in software development and system design. 

## About Me 📖
Computer Science major • Artificial Intelligence minor

## Projects 📦
Below is a collection of my Java projects, showcasing my skills in software development, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and application design.

| Project Name | Description | Technologies Used | Repository Link | Completion Date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **PYR Deployment Systems** | A rule based system for evaluating trade risk and capital deployment decisions. | Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Local Storage, API Integration, Rule Based Systems | https://github.com/itspyr/PYR-Deployment-Systems | Ongoing |
| **Scrambl** | Scrmbl is a Java-based encryption and decryption framework that reimagines a previous image-scrambling concept into a text-focused, multi-structure cipher system. The project demonstrates how different data structures—maps, graphs, and trees—can uniquely drive algorithmic encryption logic. | Java, CSS, Frameworks, Maps, Graphs, Trees, ADT's | https://github.com/zachsarc/scrmbl | Finished |


## SQL / Machine Learning Projects 🗄️
