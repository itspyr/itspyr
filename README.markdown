- **Skills**: Java, Javascript, Assembly, C, C++, HTML/CSS, SQL, Binary, LLM Prompting.

## Java Projects ♨️
Below is a collection of my Java projects, showcasing my skills in software development, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and application design.

| Project Name | Description | Technologies Used | Repository Link | Completion Date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Simple ChatBot** | Simple guided reponse Java ran chatbot. | Java | https://github.com/itspyr/ChatBot.git | February 2025 |
| **Running Log** | The running log consists of recording/calculating running pace for certain distances. | Java | https://github.com/itspyr/Running-Log.git | Ongoing |
| **Scrambl** | Scrmbl is a Java-based encryption and decryption framework that reimagines a previous image-scrambling concept into a text-focused, multi-structure cipher system. The project demonstrates how different data structures—maps, graphs, and trees—can uniquely drive algorithmic encryption logic. | Java, CSS, Frameworks, Maps, Graphs, Trees, ADT's | https://github.com/zachsarc/scrmbl | Coming soon... |

## Lessons Learned 🧠
- **Simple ChatBot**: This ChatBot allows for the user to input responses to questions asked. Responses by the user must be a specific answer which allows me to implement clear errors codes for invalid inputs. There us input validation to ensure the numbers/texts being entered by the user are fitting for the question at hand.

- **Running Log**: Throughout this project, I will be incoorperating more features such as other aspects of running- For example, recording the outdoor temperature during a run, calculating how many calories were burned during a run, cumulative running distance, etc.
