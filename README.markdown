## Lessons Learned üß†
- **Simple ChatBot**: This ChatBot allows for the user to input responses to questions asked. Responses by the user must be a specific answer which allows me to implement clear errors codes for invalid inputs. There us input validation to ensure the numbers/texts being entered by the user are fitting for the question at hand.

- **Running Log**: Throughout this project, I will be incoorperating more features such as other aspects of running- For example, recording the outdoor temperature during a run, calculating how many calories were burned during a run, cumulative running distance, etc.
